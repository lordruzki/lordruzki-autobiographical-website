Webfolio Website
==========================
Personal website to show off my projects, info about me, and cool stuff I do. My webfolio will provide links to my GitHub profile, repositories, my resume, socials, and my *possible* photography website.

body-and-links
---
This branch is meant to build up all the information displayed inside the body of the webfolio as well as all the links needed. The branches that have been created from this include:
- about-section
- portfolio-section
- photography-section
- contact-section

Additionally added:
- Improved in-file documentation
- Improvements to README file
- Added images to the <u>header</u> section that can be used later
- Additional links to the header section for my Git and LinkedIn

body-and-links/about-section
---
This branch adds the information needed to initiate the About section of the webfolio. This includes, but is not limited to:
- College <del>courses</del>
- <del>Self-taught stuff</del> <i>Not being utilized due to its lack of place in this section</i>
- High School <del>courses</del>
- Simplified method for the about-section as too much information would overshadow later, more important, parts of the webfolio.

v0.0.2 ContactLink branch
----------------------------------------

## Objective

The Contact Link is supposed to be linked from an NFC chip allowing my contact information to be shared on mobile browsers.

## Organization

Each button link is structured under a div with the class *contactButton* and storing the actual link inside it. The link itself stores the *h4* tag that is the type of link and *p* containing information for how to search the information manually.
Example:
    Instagram
    @churuizramos

For the [Add Contact] button, rather than a link, the button executes a download command for a VCF file storing said contact information. Reasearch at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8669912/add-a-contact-to-the-mobile-device-address-book-from-an-html-webpage.

VCF file is labeled [contactDownload.vcf]

## Notes

Color scheme used on this page would work well in the rest of the website. Link at the bottom will be used to access the main website.

v0.0.1c Rewrite syntax fix
----------------------------------------

## Changes
ID and Class tags were incorrectly declared in HTML source

v0.0.1b Initial Code Rewrite (7-28-2023)
----------------------------------------

## Changes

Rewrote initial code. Changed structure of information. Focusing primarily on the setup of the main page for the website.

## Reason for changes

Original code was cluttered and prepped for an illogical use basis.


v0.0.1 Initial Code State (7-5-2023)
----------------------------------------

This is a static basis including most of the files that could end up being used to create the website. Pages and their information still need to be fleshed out completely. New system should be utilized to simplify the page creation process.
